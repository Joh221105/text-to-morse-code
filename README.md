# text-to-morse-code

## Description
This project is one of the independent projects from "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" course from udemy instructed by Dr. Angela Yu. This is my code for the project as well as some additional features.

## What I Learned

## Planned Features
What I would like to do is add some features such as:

    Creating a GUI for the convertor

    Provides the user with an audio file to listen to their converted message

    Allowing the user to convert an audio file of a morse code message into text message

## Future Learning Goals
  
    Incorporation of audio libraries for planned features

    Practice with Tkinter to create GUI for app

    Practice with version control, branching, and merging branches
